    <h1>Welcome to my personal page! </h1>
    <p>Here, you’ll get a glimpse of who I am, what fuels my energy, and the things that <br> 
        truly make me happy. I’m a curious dreamer with a bold streak—always chasing fresh <br> 
        ideas and new adventures, whether it’s an exciting project or a spontaneous road trip.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I love being creative while listening to my favorite Spotify playlists. <br> 
        Coffee? Absolutely, especially if it comes with a cozy chat. And when I need a <br>  
        recharge, you’ll find me exploring new skills or curled up with a good book.</p> 
    <p>Feel free to look around, get inspired, and who knows—maybe we’ll discover something <br> 
        new together. I hope you’ll catch a spark of my upbeat, entrepreneurial spirit here. <br> 
        Don’t hesitate to browse, ask questions, or just <a href="./contact-me.html">say hello</a>.</p>
    <h3><p>Enjoy!</p></h3>

        and eye-catching images. I love how easy it is to bring my imagination to life digitally. I <br>
        highly recommend <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/explore?tab=top">giving it a try</a>, and spark some visual magic!</p>

<h2>Motto</h2>
<p>My motto? ‘What’s the goal?’ Once the goal is crystal clear, I can map out the steps and get straight <br> 
    to work—and that’s exactly what I love!</p>
